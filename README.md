# ec008-swift-kickstart-2

This is the code for the Swift 6 update to the second edition of A Swift Kickstart.

I've removed the zip files from the earlier editions. You need to use Xcode playgrounds as Swift Playgrounds are no longer supported.

The code was tested on Xcode 16.

This code will not be updated for future releases of Swift or Xcode.
